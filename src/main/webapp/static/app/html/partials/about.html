		The purpose of this demo application is to present a basic working model of a platform 
		which provides a channel between the people who are in need of a service and the people
		who	provide services and wish to advertise their business. </br></br>
		The first time a user opens the <i>Gigs</i> page, they will be prompted to share their
		location and if they do so, and if the geolocation is successful (it is recommended to 
		use Google Chrome browser), the green marker will automatically be placed on their
		current location on the map. </br>
		Alternatively, they can set their location by dragging the green marker on the map
		to their exact location. </br></br>
		The search function can be utilized in two ways: by clicking on the appropriate
		category/service name in the <i>Gigs</i> drop-down menu from the navigation bar, 
		or by using the search bar itself to search by keyword(s).  </br>
		The search results will be shown in the form of clickable markers on the map, 
		and a scrollable list next to the map.  </br>The results shown on the page will be
		related to the selection/query combined with the user's proximity/zoom-level. </br> Otherwise,
		the results will only be filtered by proximity/zoom-level, or the area the map covers. </br></br>
		Non-registered users can only search for existing services, as well as rate/comment
		the services they have used in the past. (However, this will most probably be changed 
		at some point, in order to minimize the possibility of having users giving themselves
		high ratings). </br>
		Registered users can offer their services. They can add more than one service, 
		and they can have up to two locations per service.  </br>
		There are three possible roles a registered user can have: <i>User</i>, <i>Admin</i> and <i>SysAdmin</i>.  </br>
		Users with the role <i>User</i> can only have a basic account and add services. </br>
		Users with the role <i>Admin</i> can add services, as well as view/remove other accounts if needed. </br>
		Users with the role <i>SysAdmin</i> can add services, view/remove other accounts, 
		but also have access to the application Management page.
